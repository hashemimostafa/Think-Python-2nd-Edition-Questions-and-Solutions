# =============================================================================
# The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number 
# that divides both of them with no remainder.
# One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that 
# if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd ( a,b ) = gcd (b,r).
# As a base case, we can use gcd ( a,0 ) = a.
# Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and 
# returns their greatest common divisor.
# Credit: This exercise is based on an example 
# from Abelson and Sussmanâ€™s Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.
